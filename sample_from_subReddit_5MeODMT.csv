2016-09-28 08:50,"Hey guys, I also learned about this substance through Leo. As he is I'm also researching and trying a lot about this enlightment stuff. So when i watched this video i was thinking about trying 5-meo. After browsing a bit through the deepweb i found it for about 50€ / 0,5g.
I'm a ganja smoker but I have never tried psychadelic or chemical drugs in my life yet, so I'm not quite sure how I am supposed to behave. Maybe try something like shrooms or LSD first or just dive right into it? As he is stating it looks like its even more potent than normal DMT. Any advices or thoughts?",['cocaine'],['substance']
2016-09-28 16:15,"I'd say get it if you can. It's not easy to find apparently. Maybe hold off using it until you feel ready. I don't think it's necessary to do another psychedelic first unless you're interested in trying them for fun.. because he did say that his mushroom trip after the 5meo had a similar ""aura"" (I forget the word he used) and that it was just way deeper than trips prior to the 5meo. Personally, I've tripped on mushrooms at a low dose and plan to do more with them and other things before doing 5meo, but its also because I feel I'm not mature enough to handle the 5meo trip and make sense of it. I feel like I need a year or a few years to do more meditating and inquiry and get more comfortable with death because I'd like to minimize the panic when I do try it. also it could take a while to find it so might as well focus on other things for the time being","['modafinil', 'ketamine']","['psychedelic', 'focus']"

2017-04-10 01:52,Glass bulb vaporizer or meth pipe.. Also maybe check out a nectar collector - works very well. I'm trying to figure out if an atomizer can be used - people have good experience with this method with regular DMT but I don't know if it will apply to 5-meo-DMT.,['methamphetamine'],"['glass', 'meth']"

A person with direct experience of the substance him/herself is good - and a lot of experience creates knowledge. But sometimes the freshness of an unexperienced person you still can trust can be a very cool thing.

2017-05-11 21:54,"5-Meo-DMT is not orally active except at quite high doses. I would say your experience was not likely the result of 5-Meo-DMT. That's not to say it was placebo - maybe there are other orally-active psychoactive substances in the plant.

You could try preparing a snuff from the plant and unsulffating it. That delivery route is more like to produce effects from the 5-Meo-DMT. I can't speak to the risks of snorting an unknown plant so you do so at your own risk, however.

2017-05-17 12:21,"I think the scoops are a lot better than nothing. 3mg scoops can be obtained cheaply via eBay, and while weight is going to vary with substance, one can at least be a great deal more accurate when measuring out doses than eye balling a dose say, which is liable to get you into trouble with a substance as potent and powerful as 5-MeO.

I would be a little cautious when combining 5-MeO with other things. I didn't like it in combination with DMT, the 5-MeO overpowered the DMT and they kind of clashed a bit. Cannabis does not sound bad in combination, and I'd had an LSD and psilocybin mushroom microdose with my first experience with Bufo secretion, that certainly didn't clash although I seem to recall more of my second experience with this going into it sober. I have a friend who used to enjoy using 5-MeO while peaking on LSD, he is a deep water psychonaut though. I would be interested in exploring a mushroom + 5-MeO combo in the future.

My only release dose experiences so far have come through vaping Bufo toad secretion, so hard to say what kind of 5-MeO doses were responsible.","['cocaine', 'heroin', 'bufotenine']","['substance', 'substance', 'psilocybin', 'bufo', 'bufo']"
2017-05-18 02:51,"Hey dude, yes the scoop + scale combo would definitely be best, that way one is going to have a good idea how many milligram of substance will be contained in a level 3mg scoop, which is definitely going to increase your accuracy when dosing which would be really helpful. I'm going to look up that scale, and yeah weighing the dose several times and maybe taking an average weight seems wise if there is fluctuation between weighing's.",['cocaine'],['substance']
2017-05-18 08:44,"Problem is, that scale isn't accurate to the milligram, so whatever reading you get for the scoop could be several mg off. Several scoops and you could be dangerously compounding the error. 

Edit: I suppose one way you could get more accurate with the scoop/scale would be to weigh out a much larger portion (eg 100mg) on the scale, being sure that your substance is of very even consistency, and then counting how many level scoops you get out of the 100mg and dividing that to get a better average amount for the scoop.",['cocaine'],['substance']

""So, it comes down to experimenting, carefully, on yourself. Please always have a babysitter, no matter how experienced you are-always. I won't go into the things that can happen to hard-headed people with great experience who think that they can do it all by themselves and run into trouble. Always have a babysitter who is familiar with the territory, and who can come in and hold your hand, or say the right thing. I think that psychedelics are great spiritual tools, but like a lot of spiritual experiences, they can take you to very, very dark places, and you can spend quite a lot of time wondering if you're going to get through some of these experiences. So, be careful and be very respectful of your mental, emotional, and physical health. Take care of your body, and don't take a powerful drug or plant if you're not well. As for the effect of psychedelics on my life, I couldn't begin to tell you, because I have no idea what my life would be like without them. Since I had major spiritual experiences starting when I was an infant, I assume I would have found my way to some sort of spiritual searching or exploration without their assistance.""

2017-05-18 12:47,"I totally get where Ann is coming from, but I still hold the different strokes for different folks view. I've had psychedelic experiences that I would have gained a lot more from or been much better off had I *not* been in the presence of others who were having issues that detracted from my experience. Also solo tripping allows one to go deeper than they otherwise would, the presence of others is likely to be distracting, even if a very fun and enjoyable distraction. I think there is something to be said for consuming psychedelics in a ritualised, supportive setting with others present, and I think the presence of a sober [and preferably experienced] sitter is definitely very good advice for the inexperienced, or when using really powerful substances such as 5-MeO. One of the most amazing experiences of my life, a full DMT breakthrough, took place when I was alone, and I'm not sure what the presence of a sitter would have achieved or contributed in this instance, much of my DMT trips have been solo journeys in fact and I'm quite happy with that.",['ketamine'],"['psychedelic', 'psychedelics']"

2017-05-20 11:10,I heard about this case from someone who knows one of the group of people mentioned. People highly experienced with psychedelics should have known better than to allow someone to consume alcohol and then smoke 5-MeO-DMT unsupervised.

2017-05-24 02:14,"Nice! It would be interesting to see what weights you get for level scoops of both sizes.

I was very curious about converting the HCL to freebase about a year ago and based on many questions on different boards, found that virtually no one had experience doing freebase conversions, even though they were posting tutorials. I found about three different tutorials, all recommending different techniques, and when I asked if anyone had tried them, it was radio silence. 

I'm in no way saying that this tutorial doesn't work. I would love to hear input from someone who had done it and can vouch for its efficacy.  OP, have you tried this successfully?  

Another reason that I ask: 5-MeO-DMT is so rare nowadays that no one would want to waste their precious HCL on a botched conversion.  ",['cocaine'],"['freebase', 'freebase']"
